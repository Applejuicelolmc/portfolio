# Brian's Portfolio Site

Portfolio site created with angular, used as project for learning angular and displaying my other works and interests.

## Not So Live Site (yet!)

[portfolio.juicelab.dev](https://portfolio.juicelab.dev)

## Latest preview:

These changes have not been committed yet and are experimental.

- Very basic css and layout
    - Just wanted to see what the default site looked like after deleting the original angular demo site
- Added a scrolling bar with hobbies/interests
    - I really like this one, might reuse this in other places once I'm sure.
- Added some functions in the navbar component to display a text in another font, each letter is randomized at different intervals for this effect.
    - Won't use this feature like shown in the preview in the final site, might drop this somewhere as an easter egg though.
